Development of an algorithm for detecting people and foreign objects in the area of the portal of the door of passenger public transport.

Control of door closing in public transport is carried out at the level of door mechanisms and through visual control of the driver or driver in the rear-view mirror. There are times when this control is impossible for various reasons: weather conditions, night time, stations in curves.

At the same time, one should not forget about the human factor: the driver or driver may be distracted, and the person performs the action of landing and disembarking at the moment the door automation is triggered, the passengers of the door mechanism are clamped, which can lead to traumatic accidents. To prevent such cases, visual control of the door portal by a person is insufficient.

To exclude the proposed methods of testing the portal of doors on the Krymskaya platform of the Moscow Central Ring.
