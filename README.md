Development of an algorithm for detecting individuals and foreign objects in the vicinity of the doorway of passenger public transport.

The control of door closure in public transport is typically managed through door mechanisms and visual checks by the driver or rear-view mirror monitoring. However, there are circumstances when conducting such controls becomes impractical due to factors like adverse weather conditions, nighttime, or when stations are curved.

Simultaneously, the human factor should not be overlooked: the driver might be distracted, and passengers might be in the process of boarding or disembarking precisely when the door automation initiates. This situation can result in passengers getting caught in the door mechanism, potentially leading to accidents and injuries. Relying solely on visual checks by an individual for door portal supervision is inadequate.

To address these concerns, alternative approaches for assessing the door portal on the Krymskaya platform of the Moscow Central Ring are being explored and implemented.
